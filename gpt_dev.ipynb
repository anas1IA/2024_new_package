Below are the different types of encoding techniques and architectures:\n",

        "### Observation on Vocabulary Size and Sequence Length in NLP:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Very small vocabularies lead to very long sequences of integers.**\n",
        "- **Very large vocabularies lead to very short sequences of integers.**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Detailed Observations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Very small vocabularies:** When the vocabulary size is small, each word in the text has to be represented by multiple tokens, resulting in very long sequences of integers. This is because many words will be broken down into smaller subwords or characters to fit within the limited vocabulary.\n",
        "  - **Example:**\n",
        "    - Vocabulary: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, ...}\n",
        "    - Sentence: \"Hello world\"\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Very large vocabularies:** When the vocabulary size is large, each word in the text can be represented by a single token, resulting in very short sequences of integers. This is because the extensive vocabulary can cover a wide range of words directly, reducing the need for subword tokenization.\n",
        "  - **Example:**\n",
        "    - Vocabulary: {'hello': 1, 'world': 2, ...}\n",
        "    - Sentence: \"Hello world\"\n",
        "    - Encoded Sequence: [1, 2] (assuming each word is a separate token)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Bag of Words (BoW)**\n",
        "- **Description:** Represents text as an unordered collection of words, ignoring grammar and word order. Each word in the text is mapped to a unique integer ID, and the text is represented by a vector counting the occurrences of each word.\n",
        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  - Text: \"I love NLP and I love Python.\"\n",

        "  - **Example:**\n",
        "    - \"running\" might be broken into trigrams: [\"run\", \"unn\", \"nni\", \"nin\", \"ing\"], and each trigram has its own vector.\n",

        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  - Text: \"I love NLP.\"\n",
        "  - Each word is processed sequentially, updating the hidden state at each step.\n",
        "  - Final hidden state represents the entire sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LSTM:**\n",

        "  - **Example:**\n",
        "    - Sentence: \"The long-term dependencies in this sentence are handled well by LSTMs.\"\n",
        "    - LSTM updates its cell state to remember or forget information as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **GRU:**\n",
        "  - **Description:** Simplified version of LSTMs with fewer gates.\n",

        "### 6. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Text**\n",
        "- **Description:** Uses convolutional layers to capture local patterns in text, often used for sentence and document classification.\n",
        "- **Example:**\n",
        "  - Text: \"NLP with CNNs is effective.\"\n",
        "  - Convolutional filters slide over the text to capture n-gram patterns.\n",
        "  - Pooling layers reduce dimensionality, followed by fully connected layers for classification.\n",

        "- Attention is a **communication mechanism**. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\n",
        "- There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n",
        "- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n",
        "- In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.\n",
        "- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries these nodes (  hers means tokens  are slef-attending). In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
        "- \"Scaled\" attention additional divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below"
